            <h2>Thursday the 20th of July 2023</h2>
            <p>Today was a great day.</p>
            <p>I did a lot of React. I spent most of the day obsessively listening to "Jon Batiste Interlude" on Lana del Rey's new album. I'm hooked. I also listened to other songs on repeat - oh no wait it was this one all day LOL. It's STUNNING.</p>
            <img src={lana1} id="lana1" alt="Album cover for Lana del Rey's 'Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean boulevard' album. Black and white Lana del Rey's face pouting with her chin in her hand and her hair tied in ribbons." />
            <p>What did I do today in React?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I read over my instructor's 2 React snippets he sent me - and I watched his video he sent me on them, AMAZING.</li>
                <li>I read over a new Senior Engineer's tips on React and I made a note of them as well.</li>
                <li>I read over my bootcamp's intro to React on our SWE Learning Plans page. It was AMAZING OMG.</li>
            </ul>
